How to run:

1. Clone this project
2. In intellij, right click on build.gradle and click on Link gradle project
3. Run the main method in Main.java

Note: Any time you are prompted to enter a board size, enter 20. We still need to fix some bugs with a dynamic board size. 
4. Run GraphicsMain.java. 
  - Since there is no serialized game in the beginning, you first will need to enter a board size to make a game (see note).
  - You can now move around and interact with the game. 

5. Press the "save" button. Once you press this, you can exit the game. 

6. Relaunch the game, now you are prompted to either start anew or continue from the old save. You can pick whichever option you want and continue from there.
